      <h4>TraveLight</h4>
      <p>illness aside, the second biggest thing that was effected within people’s lives during the pandemic was their finances. As we enter a “post-pandemic” life people will look to travel after not being able to for over two years. But unfortunately, travel has gotten even more expensive than it was prior to the pandemic. Making travel very difficult for many people.Our goal is to help users find the cheapest option for their flights and stays by pulling data from multiple sources and comparing them; then offering the options to the user , all while displaying price trends to the users. (refer to the application Honey). These solutions will be evident throughout our design.</p>
